# Computer Science & Cybersecurity Learning Path

## Overview

This repository contains my personalized computer science and cybersecurity curriculum, built from multiple highly-regarded educational resources, including the [OSSU (Open Source Society University)](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) curriculum and additional specialized cybersecurity materials. I've structured this as a comprehensive self-directed learning path with a focus on cybersecurity specialization.

## Repository Structure

- **[comprehensive-course-outline.md](comprehensive-course-outline.md)**: The complete curriculum structured by year and semester, including all courses, projects, and resources.
  
- **[progress-tracker.md](progress-tracker.md)**: A detailed checklist format of the curriculum to track progress through individual courses and projects.
  
- **[CS50-python-projects.md](CS50-python-projects.md)**: Collection of projects from Harvard's CS50 Python course, with my implementations and notes.
  
- **[project-based-learning-projects-resources.md](project-based-learning-projects-resources.md)**: Curated list of hands-on programming projects organized by language and technology.
- **[official-documentation.md](official-documentation.md)**: Curated collection provides links to official documentation for various programming languages.

## Using This Repository

### For New Visitors

If you're interested in following a similar learning path:

1. Start by reviewing the **comprehensive-course-outline.md** to understand the full curriculum structure
2. Use the **progress-tracker.md** as a template to track your own progress
3. Explore the project resources for practical applications of concepts you're learning

### For My Personal Use

This repository serves as my:
- Central roadmap for education in computer science and cybersecurity
- Progress tracking system for courses and projects
- Reference for project ideas and resources
- Documentation of my learning journey

## Curriculum Highlights

The curriculum is designed as a four-year equivalent program:

- **Year 1**: Foundations in programming, mathematics, and core CS concepts
- **Year 2**: Core computing principles, algorithms, data structures, and security basics
- **Year 3**: Advanced topics in computer science and specialized areas
- **Year 4**: Cybersecurity specialization and professional certification preparation

## Cybersecurity Focus

This curriculum has a specialized focus on cybersecurity, including:

- Core security principles and methodologies
- Ethical hacking and penetration testing
- Network security and cryptography
- Supply chain security specialization
- Professional certification preparation (Security+, PenTest+, OSCP)

## Progress Updates

I regularly update my progress in the [progress-tracker.md](progress-tracker.md) file. Current status:
- Completed: 
- In Progress: CS50 Intro to programming with Python
- Upcoming:
